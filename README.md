# AntiAFK Modes

## 🚀 High-Performance Mode *(Recommended for ~1-5 Instances)*: 
1. Launch Roblox windows.
2. Minimize the ones you’re not actively using.
2. Click “Hide Roblox” — minimized windows will briefly maximize and then disappear from the taskbar!

**✔ Best suited for:**
- Active use of PC (this mode is extremely fast)
- Running a small number of Roblox instances

## 💤 Energy-Efficient Mode *(Recommended for ~1-15 Instances)*: 
1. Minimize Roblox windows.
2. Enable "Open for ... sec" — this briefly brings the window into focus (useful if the game often reboots servers).
3. *(optional)* Enable "Hide window contents" to make the window invisible while focused.
4. You’ll get a notification ~3 seconds before a window comes into focus, so you can pause your work if needed. 

**✔ Best suited for:**
- Less active use of PC.
- Running a large number of minimized Roblox instances (minimized windows use fewer resources!)

## 💡 Tips for Running Many Instances: 
- Automatically clear memory using `Mem Reduct`.
- Lower FPS (`FPS Unlocker`, `Roblox Account Manager`).
- Keep Roblox windows minimized whenever possible.
- Reduce graphics settings in both your GPU control panel and the Roblox client.
- Close unnecessary background programs.
- Monitor CPU usage in Task Manager (try to stay below 90–95%).
- Use [`Bloxstrap`](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap) for even better optimization (see setup guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEiRnw8PYOk&list=LL&index=1&pp=gAQBiAQB)).

## 🌙 Night Grinding Mode: 
1. Lower screen brightness.
2. In your system settings, set the screen to turn off after 1 minute of inactivity.
3. Click “Open Screensaver” to activate a black screen
*(Note: moving the mouse will exit the screensaver)*

## 🔎 Troubleshooting:
- If Roblox windows don’t focus in time or key presses fail to register, try increasing the delay in `settings.json`.
*(This file is generated automatically on first launch. Restart the program to apply changes.)*
- Switching the **Action Type** to **CameraShift** may improve reliability, as it involves more interactions with the Roblox window.
