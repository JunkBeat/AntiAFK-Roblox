# 🎮 AntiAFK Modes 🎮

## 🚀 High-Performance Mode (for ~1-5 Instances): 
- Launch your Roblox game(s).
- If running multiple instances, minimize the ones you don’t need and click "Hide Roblox"—they'll maximize and disappear from the taskbar!

**✔ Best for:**
- Active computer use (this mode is extremely fast!) 
- Running multiple Roblox instances

## 💤 Energy-Efficient Mode (for ~1-15 Instances): 
- Minimize your Roblox windows.
- Enable "Open for ... sec" to briefly bring a window into focus (useful for server restarts or game reloads).
- Turn on "Hide window contents" to keep the window's content hidden when focused.

**✔ Best for:**
- When you're not actively using your computer. 
- When running many Roblox instances (minimized windows use fewer resources!).

## 💡 Tips on how to run multiple instances: 
- Automatically clear memory using Mem Reduct.
- Lower FPS (FPS Unlocker, Roblox Account Manager).
- Keep Roblox windows minimized most of the time.
- Reduce graphics quality in video card settings and in the Roblox client settings.
- Close unnecessary programs.

## 🌙 Night Grinding: 
- Reduce your screen brightness.
- In your system settings, set your screen to turn off after 1 minute of inactivity.
- Click "Open Screensaver" to make the screen completely black. (Note: moving the mouse will dismiss the screensaver!)
